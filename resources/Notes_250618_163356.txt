PROMPT ENGINEERING FINETUNING

1. Prompt Co-construction: Input your prompt and ask the LLM to fine-tune for fast production  of
    very precise and effective prompts.

Steps:
- General structure of your prompt
- Iterative refinement to match desired result
- Iterative integration of edge cases or specific needs

A good tip that generally helps a lot is to require the LLM to ask questions before proposing prompt modifications to insure it fully understand the need

2. Use self-evaluation
Force the LLM to self-evaluate quality of its answer before outputting it.
Ask it to rate its own answer on a predefined scale e.g. 1 to 10.
Ask it to improve the answer if it is below a desirable threshold


OPTIMIZE PYTHON SCRIPTS USING LLMS
Prompt 1: Id bottlenecks and chained operations.
"In the script, identify which operations are likely causing slowdowns and suggest a more efficient approach"

Prompt 2: Memory Efficiency
"Improve the code to reduce memory usage for the dataset, while maintaining efficiency"

Prompt 3: Parallel processing
Independent calculations like row-wise transformations, can be paralleled for faster execution.
Useful for simulation tasks or applying expensive functions across a dataset
"Which parts of the code can run in parallel, while maintaining efficiency?"

Prompt 4: Efficient Grouping
Implementing aggregates like averages, maximum can slow implementation via loops.
"how to efficiently perform summary statistics on the dataset?"

Prompt 5: Vectorized Calculations
Row-wise implementations are slow. Vectorized implementations in pandas and numpy are faster
"use vectorized implementation to find the given metric/purpose using the given code to improve efficiency and speed"

Prompt 6: Efficient Filtering and Sorting
Filtering and Sorting are slow when using loops.
"provide efficient solution to filter and sort the following data"

Prompt 7: Using NumPy for Distance Calculation
math computations e.g. Euclidean distances over large datasets can be extremely slow when loops are used.
"perform calculation between features using most efficient python code to reduce memory usage and speed up processing"
